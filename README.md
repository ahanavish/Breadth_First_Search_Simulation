<h1> PROBLEM STATEMENT </h1>
Gagannaut Anand wants to go to moon in a Chandravahan. But Chandravahan object destroyer beam is damaged so the harmful objects need to be avoided at all costs to keep Gagannaut Anand safe and India's hopes of a brightfuture alive. You are working in the Control and Operational team of ISRO which regulates Satellite's launch, re-orbiting, disposal, etc. You need to perform certain checks to make Chandravahan decipher the shortest possible path between two satellites and to avoid any possible orbital.

<br/>

<h1> SOLUTION </h1>
This Unity project uses  Breadth First Search algorithm to find the shortest path between 2 satellites.
BFS is an algorithm to find the shortest path between two points. 

<br/>

<h1> HOW TO USE </h1> 
Set the transform of START and END point on the script attached to the Node gameobject and press play button. The first Satellite will spawn at the starting point and move towards the end point, through the path generated by the BFS algorithm.  <br/>

<h1> TOOL USED </h1>
Unity game engine<br/>


Goto Builds and click on the .exe file to play the game.
